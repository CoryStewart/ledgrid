Some of the sprite_sheets require attribution and/or may be copyrighted.  So I'm not including them
in the git repo.  They're available on the internet though, so here is where to find them:

                              Note: I use the 'make_mrs_pacman_sheet.py' to reduce the size of the sprites
                              in the 'mrs_pacman.gif' file and I write out 16x16 pixel versions to:
                              'mrs_pacman_16x16.png'.

                              Note: this one has a white background that I don't like. So I'll need to write
                              a PIL script to remove it.  But it seems to have a few more sprites than the
                              mrs_pacman one.
